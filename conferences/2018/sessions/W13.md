## Abstract  

Audubon Core is a set of vocabularies designed to describe biodiversity-related multimedia resources and collections. Audubon Core was adopted as a TWDG standard in 2014. The Audubon Core Maintenance Group was established to maintain the standard and its documentation. The purpose of this first workshop of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group is twofold: (1) to inform potential users on what Audubon Core is and how to use it and (2) to discover areas of weakness in Audubon Core, i.e. things the standard currently does not do that people would like for it to do. An important aim of the workshop is to identify what the needs and who the stakeholders are. Uninvited contributions of use cases are welcomed, but a significant part of the time will be spent on discussion of things people bring up during the session. Almost everybody in the TDWG and SPNHC communities has to deal with media at some point, even if it is not their principal area of interest, and we look forward to an interesting discussion.
