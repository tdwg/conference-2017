**Workshop Proposal for SPNHC + TDWG 2018 Conference** 

Workshop title: 

**Service-based content extraction from digitised specimens** 

Abstract: 

With the continuously improving technologies for collection mass-digitisation, specimen data capture became the major cost factor in the digitisation process. Improved user interfaces alleviate the problem to a certain degree, but new methods need to be developed in order to keep pace with high-throughput digitisation workflows. 

A promising approach to overcoming the bottleneck is the use and integration of domain-specific and generic web-services for automatic content extraction. These services can, for instance, be used to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functions, text-mining, as well as image analyses and feature detection. 

In the workshop, services for content extraction from specimen images will be presented. We will also discuss effective mechanisms for integrating available services in research data management platforms such as OpenRefine.
