<h2>Call for Abstracts</h2>
     We are happy to announce the Call for Abstracts for the TDWG 2017
meeting. (Please see the <a href="instructions/index.html">instructions


for submitting abstracts</a>.) In a change for TDWG, abstract
submission this year will be done through the Pensoft ARPHA
platform. Many of you are already familiar with ARPHA, which
supports and facilitates collaborative authoring, manuscript review,
feedback to authors, publication, and post-publication review and
discussion.&nbsp; One of the benefits that will come from this is
that abstracts will be published in Proceedings of TDWG, hosted by
Pensoft. Published abstracts will be assigned DOIs, and will be
available for post-publication review. <br>
<br>
The TDWG 2017 organizing committee has worked with Pensoft to
customize the ARPHA workflow in a way that makes sense for TDWG.
Please note that you can add references, a figure, a table, and
supplementary materials without these being counted towards your
total word limit. It is likely that there will be some hiccups, and
we ask for your patience throughout the process. Help is available
via the ARPHA tool's "Helpdesk" icon, or via email to <a
href="mailto:tdwgproceedings@pensoft.net">
tdwgproceedings@pensoft.net.</a> <br>
<br>
As previously announced, TDWG 2017 has a rich collection of
workshops and symposia to which you can contribute [link]. Abstracts
are required for all oral presentations (with the exception of “wild
ideas”, see below), computer demonstrations, and posters. These
categories are described below. We look forward to your
contributions, and to seeing you in Ottawa in the Fall.<br>
<br>
<h3> Types of Contributions:</h3>
<h4> Symposia or Workshop Presentations</h4>
The backbone of a TDWG meeting are its symposia and workshops. At
TDWG, a symposium is typically a collection of talks, sometimes with
a panel or open discussion; a workshop may have talks, but typically
encourages more active engagement through training activities, or
through facilitated discussion around a key issue.&nbsp; Accepted
symposia and workshops are listed <a
href="https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2017/program/">here</a>,
along with an indication of whether or not the symposium/workshop is
accepting submissions. If you would like to give a talk, you should
see if any open workshops/symposia are suitable.<br>
<h4> Other Oral Presentations</h4>
If no workshop or symposium is suitable, you can submit your
abstract to the "Other Oral Presentation" track. Accepted abstracts
will be arranged so that talks on similar subjects are in the same
session.<br>
<h4> Computer demonstrations</h4>
We will provide an opportunity for live computer demonstrations.
Note that rooms for these presentations may have WiFi connections
only (not wired), and you may want to have a backup plan should the
internet connection not work to your satisfaction.<br>
<h4> Posters</h4>
We will provide dedicated space for posters, and at least one
dedicated poster session on the agenda. Instructions on poster size
will be posted nearer the conference.<br>
<h4> 5-Minute Wild Ideas/Unconference</h4>
Towards the end of the conference, we will have a “Wild Ideas”
session, with talks selected via an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>-style
procedure. Abstracts will not be required for these.<br>
