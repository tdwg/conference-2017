<h4>The TDWG 2017 Annual Conference will take place in Ottawa, Canada from 1 to 6 October 2017 at the Delta Hotel by Marriot. The theme this year is associating occurrences with genes, phenotypes and environments. Themes will include standards for metagenomics, environmental sampling, and [climate change] resesarch as well as more applied topics such as biodiversity monitoring, plant health and food security.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are soliciting symposia and individual presentations that address the theme, but any contribution addressing the management, integration, and interoperability of biodiversity information will be entertained.</p>
<p>Computer demonstrations, contributed papers, and meetings of TDWG Interest/Task Groups will be accommodated as fully as possible. If the number of contributed papers exceeds the space available, authors may be asked to contribute posters.&nbsp;2017 will be a VERY busy year in Canada, and especially the Ottawa region. Please contact us as soon as possible regarding any known or potential plans, as we can help coordinate reserving meeting spaces for interest or task groups.</p>
<p>Posters are strongly encouraged as a means of presenting ongoing innovative activities in the community for which program time may not be available.</p>

<p>One of the reasons that we are very excited to host TDWG 2017 in Ottawa, is that in 2017 Canada is celebrating its 150th birthday! Many events and celebrations are planned throughout the year.</p>
<p>As a result of this year-long celebration, Ottawa is going to be very busy all year, hotels and other accomodations are going to be fully booked well in advance. Most Canadian hotels have very flexible cancellation rates, and reservations can typically by cancelled with no charges or fees up to days before the booking (varies by hotel). This means that you should <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BOOK YOUR ACCOMODATION NOW!</strong></span> (see below for options).</p>
<p>With&nbsp;the conference being held at the Delta Hotel, we are trying to keep the associated conference costs low. This entails a commitment to room reservations at the Delta.
