**Abstract:** 

This workshop aims to present some state-of-the-art in the application of deep learning technics and methods to various aspects of biodiversity studies. We already saw a few of very interesting developments at TDWG 2017 ([https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20302](https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20302), [https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400](https://doi.org/10.3897/tdwgproceedings.1.20400), [https://biss.pensoft.net/article/20569/](https://biss.pensoft.net/article/20569/)   Deep learning applications in biodiversity (as in many other knowledge domains) is exploding. The potential of these methodologies for classification (e.g., species recognition in images) or pattern recognition (e.g., species distribution models) is immense.   The time is now. This is an opportunity to create a community and start working on common approaches, coordinate efforts, and seek collaborations. Consequently, we need to also develop standards and recommended practices. Topics for discussions and consensus building exchanges include, but are not limited to:    • How to involve and give credit to domain experts who provide labeled training datasets. • How to elaborate standards to describe the methodologies and the nature of the training datasets of the identification platforms, so users can be more aware of the capabilities and limitations. • Review of improvement techniques such as, transfer-learning and data-augmentation. • How to develop standards to facilitate exchange of data (and datasets) and integration of artificial intelligence frameworks. • Pros and cons of different platforms for deep learning development and deployment. • How to exploit unsupervised learning on the biodiversity domain.   The TDWG annual meeting is an excellent opportunity to gather those involved in these developments and to overcome these and other challenges.
