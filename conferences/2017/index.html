<h3>About the Meeting</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.agr.gc.ca/">Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada</a> and the <a href="http://www.nature.ca">Canadian Museum of Nature</a> will host the <strong>2017
Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)</strong> conference in
Ottawa, Canada, Oct. 1 - Oct. 6. It is critical that you contact us at <a href="mailto:conference@tdwg.org">conference@tdwg.org</a> as soon as possible if you would like to host an
event (e.g. training, a hackathon, or a workshop) either
before or after the TDWG meeting, as accommodation space will
be limited. Several options for venues are available. Use <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tdwg17">#TDWG17</a> to stay informed.</p>
<p>Standards for the description and exchange of biodiversity
information help promote research, support decision-making for
conservation and planning, and provide a means of
communicating observations across taxa, sub-disciplines, and
political boundaries.</p>

<p>The annual TDWG conference serves two purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is is a forum for extending, refining, and developing
standards in response to new challenges and opportunities;
and</li>
<li>it is a showcase for biodiversity informatics - much of
which relies on the specifications provided by TDWG and
other standards organizations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Theme</h3>
<p>The theme this year is <em>Data Integration in a Big Data
Universe: Associating Occurrences with Genes, Phenotypes, and
Environments</em>.</p>

<p>Associating genotypes with phenotypes has been the subject
of previous TDWG symposia, and remains one of the great
ongoing challenges of biodiversity science. It is complicated
by our increased (but still nascent) understanding of the role
played by microbiomes in phenotype expression. As Bob Robbins
pointed out in his <a
href="http://www.rj-robbins.com/slides/RJR-TDWG-2012.pdf">2012
keynote</a>, some microbial genes, due to inter-species
horizontal gene transfer, are better understood as attributes
of a particular ecosystem than of a particular species.
Meanwhile, "habitat" remains one of the most over-burdened of
Darwin Core terms, conflating climate, geology, taxonomic
association, and other environmental variables. Our theme is
intended to provoke discussion around questions such as: Can
current systems, methods, and schemas be used to capture and
understand patterns of association amongst occurrences, genes,
phenotypes, and environments? If so, how? If not, what gaps
need to be filled?</p>
    
<h3>Keynotes and Scientific Program</h3>
<p>We are excited to announce that keynote addresses will be delivered by 
<a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/museum-voices/soltis-lab/">Pam Soltis</a>
and <a href="http://iphylo.blogspot.ca/">Rod Page</a>. 
The <a href="program/">scientifc program</a> includes a diverse and ambitious collection of 
workshops and symposia, many of which are accepting submissions.</p>
    

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The meeting will take place at the Delta Hotels Ottawa City Centre at 101 Lyon Street North, Ottawa, Ontario. It is a 10min walk to Canada's gothic Parliament Buildings, which stand above the banks of the Ottawa River, a major tributary of the St. Lawrence River.</p>

<h3>Welcome to Ottawa!</h3>
<p>One of the reasons that we are very excited to host TDWG 2017 in Ottawa, is that in 2017 Canada is celebrating its 150th birthday! Many events and celebrations are planned throughout the year. Learn more about the celebrations at <a href="http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1468262573081">Canada 150</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.ottawa2017.ca/">Ottawa 2017</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of this year-long celebration, Ottawa is going to be very busy all year and thus hotels and other accommodations are going to be fully booked well in advance. Most Canadian hotels have very flexible cancellation rates, and reservations can typically by cancelled with no charges or fees up to days before the booking (varies by hotel). This means that you should <a href="accommodations/">BOOK YOUR ACCOMMODATION NOW!</strong></a> Booking early also helps us plan better to make sure accommodation and conference facilities are appropriately sized.</p>
