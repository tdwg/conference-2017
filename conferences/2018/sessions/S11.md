<!--
**Number of 80-minute sessions** - 1 or 2
**Additional Notes:**
All panelists have been contacted and have expressed interest in participating. I have one additional person, Lee Belbin, 'in the pocket' should Andrew Cox not confirm his participation (he is concerned about travel costs). Additionally, I have also contacted invasive species expert Philip Hulme (who resides in Christchurch) and am waiting for his reply, so actually it might be a good idea to request two 80-minute sessions: I will keep you informed of developments.

##Format 
Panelists will each have 15 minutes to briefly describe a success and a challenge related to their work with invasive species data, followed by a 20-minute discussion. (one 80-minute session). Additional panelists will be accepted only if the organizing committee is willing to authorize an additional 80 minutes to the session.  


## Abstract

New Zealand and Australia are global leaders in developing coordinated and early response to biological invasions for successful invasive species control, but in spite of our best efforts worldwide, the economic impact of invasive species at a global level remains overwhelming. Leading scientific experts in sharing invasive species data (from the region and the globe) will briefly describe their successes and challenges in standards development, outreach, coordinating citizen scientists, and creating prioritized species checklists. The session will end with a general Q/A and discussion among panelists and participants.  

###Topics/Panelists  
* "Leveraging citizen science data to monitor invasive species Belgium" Quentin Groom, Botany and Information Technology, Botanic Garden Meise, Belgium quentin.* "Introducing the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species: challenges with classification" Shyama Pagad, IUCN Species Survival Commission's Invasive Species Specialist Group, New Zealand
* "Invasive species standards for policy development" Andrew Cox, CEO, Australian Invasive Species Council, Australia
* "Vocabulary challenges with invasive species data sharing" Annie Simpson 

###Bios  
* Andrew Cox was appointed as CEO of the Invasive Species Council in 2014 after serving as its president for two years. He is vice chair of Environmental Justice Australia and president of 4nature, as well as a member of the NSW Biosecurity Advisory Committee.  

* Quentin Groomis a researcher based at the Botanic Garden Meise, Belgium. He works on the digitization and dissemination of biodiversity data, but is also interested in the use of these data for biodiversity monitoring, particularly for invasive species.  

* Shyama Pagad s the Programme officer of the IUCN SSC Invasive Species Specialist Group, based at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Her main area of work currently is the development of the Global Register of Introduced and Invasive Species ([GRIIS](http://www.griis.org/)) and invasive alien species related biodiversity indicators.  

* Annie Simpson is an entomologist and information scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, based in Reston, Virginia, USA, and formerly convener of the Invasive Species Information Systems Interest Group of TDWG. She recruits federal and invasive species datasets for inclusion in the USGS Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation ([BISON](https://bison.usgs.gov/#home)) online species mapping application.
