## Abstract  

Scientists use a variety of methods to collect, record, and store biological interaction data (predator-prey, parasite-host, pollinator-plant, etc.). Uses for these data are equally diverse. For example, they could play an important role in building decision support systems for conservation and sustainable use in agriculture. Numerous efforts are underway to aggregate, organize, and efficiently disseminate these data. However, we lack a formal data standard to support this work. During the 2016 TDWG Conference, in Santa Clara de San Carlos, Costa Rica, a group of people gathered to start discussing this issue under the TDWG umbrella and eventually in 2017 an Interest Group on Biological Interactions Data was created within TDWG and a first symposium was held in Ottawa, at TDWG2017. This workshop will serve to provide an update of the IG activities, advance in the discussions and plan the following year. The session is open to all interested parties.
