<h2>Call for Abstracts</h2>

<p class="lead">In a change for TDWG, abstract
submission this year will be done through the Pensoft ARPHA
platform, which
supports and facilitates collaborative authoring, manuscript review,
feedback to authors, publication, and post-publication review and
discussion. Abstracts will be published in Proceedings of TDWG, hosted by
Pensoft. Published abstracts will be assigned DOIs, and will be
available for post-publication review.</p>
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning" id="callout-type-dl-truncate"><h4>Deadlines</h4>
  <p><strong>The deadline for initial submission of abstracts is <strike>July 14</strike> July 21</strong>. The organizers of the track to which you are submitting may accept or reject your submission, or may send feedback requesting changes. You will receive final notice from the organizers by August 14. Once the abstract is accepted, you must then complete your submission by <strong>September 5</strong> for inclusion in both the conference program and in the Proceedings of TDWG. Please see the <a href="instructions/">submission instructions</a> where a link is included to the ARPHA submission system.</p>
</div>

<p>The TDWG 2017 organizing committee has worked with Pensoft to
customize the ARPHA workflow in a way that makes sense for TDWG.
Please note that you can add references, a figure, a table, and
supplementary materials without these being counted towards your
total word limit. It is likely that there will be some hiccups, and
we ask for your patience throughout the process. Help is available
via the ARPHA tool's "Helpdesk" icon, or via email to <a
href="mailto:tdwgproceedings@pensoft.net">
tdwgproceedings@pensoft.net</a>.</p>

<p>As previously announced, TDWG 2017 has a rich collection of
<a href="../program/">workshops and symposia</a> to which you can contribute. Abstracts are required for oral presentations, computer demonstrations, and posters. The only exception is “wild
ideas” (see below), which do not require abstracts. These
categories are described below. We look forward to your
contributions and to seeing you in Ottawa in October.</p>

<h3 class="header">Types of Contributions</h3>
<h4 class="header">Symposia or Workshop Presentations</h4>

<p>The backbone of a TDWG meeting are its symposia and workshops. A symposium is typically a collection of talks, sometimes with
a panel or open discussion. A workshop may have talks, but typically
encourages more active engagement through training activities or
through facilitated discussion around a key issue. Accepted
symposia and workshops are listed <a
href="../program/">here</a>
along with an indication of whether or not the symposium/workshop organizers are
accepting unsolicited submissions. If you would like to give a talk, you should
first see if any open workshops/symposia match your topic.</p>

<h4 class="header">Other Oral Presentations</h4>
<p>If no workshop or symposium is suitable, you can submit your
abstract to the "Other Oral Presentation" category. The organizing committee will attempt to schedule similar talks in the same
session.</p>

<h4 class="header">Computer demonstrations</h4>
<p>We will provide an opportunity for live computer demonstrations.
Note that rooms for these presentations may have WiFi connections
only (not wired), and you are advised to have a backup plan should the
internet connection not work to your satisfaction.</p>

<h4 class="header">Posters</h4>
<p>We will provide dedicated space for posters and at least one
dedicated poster session on the agenda. Instructions on poster size
will soon be stated on the <a href="../faq/">FAQs</a>.</p>

<h4 class="header">5-Minute Wild Ideas/Unconference</h4>
<p>Towards the end of the conference, we will have a “Wild Ideas”
session, with talks selected via an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a>-style
procedure. Abstracts are not be required for this category of submission.</p>
