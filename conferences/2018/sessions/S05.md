## Abstract

The GGBN ([http://www.ggbn.org](http://www.ggbn.org)) is based on a Memorandum of Cooperation and is an unincorporated, international network of member organizations, which share the aim of making high-quality, well-documented, and vouchered genomic samples of the Earth's biodiversity discoverable for research. The mission and objective of GGBN is to foster collaborations among biodiversity repositories in order to comply with quality standards, best practices, interoperability, and exchange of material in accordance with national and international legislation and conventions, thereby benefiting society through additional research contributing to development and biodiversity conservation. The GGBN Data Standard provides a platform based on a documented agreement to promote the efficient sharing and usage of genomic sample material and associated specimen information in a consistent way. It builds upon existing standards commonly used within the community extending them with the capability to exchange data on tissue, environmental and DNA samples as well as sequences. The GGBN Data Standard has been recently extended to support environmental DNA and HTS library samples.

While respecting national law, GGBN requires that its members comply with the provisions of the Nagoya-protocol. Thus researchers, collection-holding institutions, and networks should adopt a common Best Practice approach to manage ABS, as has been developed by GGBN. A Code of Conduct; recommendations for implementing the Code of Conduct (the Best Practices), and implementation tools, such as standard Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) and mandatory and recommended data fields in collection databases, are tools which will aid compliance.

Here we give an overview on current GGBN activities and our goals for the future. This session comprises updates on the GGBN Data Standard, the GGBN Data Portal, and GGBN's best practices on ABS and the Nagoya Protocol, with examples of their use and applicability for information sharing across existing and upcoming data aggregators and portals.
