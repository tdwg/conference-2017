##Abstract  

Environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a very popular method where environmental samples from media such as soil, air or water, but also processed food item for example for screening presence and identifications of organisms, rather than identifying the organisms individually. The aim of this session is to be join between TDWG and SPNCH over the challenges and usages of e-DNA in the domain of bio-monitoring and quality assessments. Talks will be about how e-DNA data fit into the TDWG standards, how they can interlink with standards used in bio-monitoring and data quality assessments. On the SPNCH side the aspect such as voucher specimens, their handling, storage as reference will be addressed. The controversial questions of needed taxonomic references and about complementarity of metagenomics versus morphological identifications will be discussed in the presentations. Cross thematic are the application of legislation and recommendations such as the Nagoya protocol on sharing genetic resources and its impact on the domain. The COST Action DNAquanet will serve as example in this context, as the aim is to have DNA methods officially endorsed by the European Commission for assessing the quality of different waterbodies (freshwater, marine waters, underground waters). The session will also be open to speakers from other domains, wishing to demonstrate how e-DNA can be used for monitory and quality assessments.
