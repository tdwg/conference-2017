## Abstract  

 In the last few years, the Living Atlases community around the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) tools has grown really fast. For the first time, during the 2018 International Living Atlases workshop that will take place in Madrid in February, we will have 25 participants coming from 19 different countries on 6 continents. Thanks to the workshop that we proposed and made during the TDWG 2017 in Ottawa, several institutions or GBIF nodes have shown interest in some ALA modules and will participate in the training in Madrid.  Because using the ALA platform as a national data portal is the solution recommended in the GBIF Implementation Plan 2017 - 2021, but also because ALA modules work with standards defined by the TDWG community, we would like to continue to work with you in order to increase the effort started last year to create a bigger Living Atlases community, by proposing another workshop less technical this time and more focused on user experience.  During this workshop, we would like to present concrete examples - outside ALA - of running modules to help technical, but also non-technical participants understand the different possibilities given by these softwares.

 

This workshop will be divided into two sessions of 80 minutes. The first one will focus on the community introduction, architecture description and demonstration of basic modules such as the collectory registry and the occurrence search engine. The second session will give the opportunity to participants to discover more advanced tools, still developed by ALA and installed in other GBIF nodes or institutions, as the species search engine (named BIE) or the spatial portal. We would like to take some time to present use cases to show how institutions could share some technical challenges or impediments (hosting, technical staff, etc.).
