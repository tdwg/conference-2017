## Abstract  

Workforce development in biodiversity computing skills for our community is strongly needed. Before the last three TDWG meetings, iDigBio has conducted Data or Software Carpentry workshops to teach these skills. Before SPNHC this year the Smithsonian, SPNHC, and iDigBio put on a Biodiversity Informatics 101 workshop. Not everyone can attend an international meeting to get this training though. In order to increase the number of Carpentry workshops in our community, we want to organize a 2-day Carpentry instructor training workshop. The Carpentries instructor curriculum teaches methods and pedagogy for running inclusive technical workshops for beginners. Attendees can go on to complete a certification process to become certified Carpentry instructors. Certified instructors can lead their own Carpentry branded workshops at their institutions. Our goal is for attendees of this instructor workshop to return to their home institutions and teach regular Carpentry workshops. This will provide an economically sustainable capacity building strategy, removing the need for outside support to improve local biodiversity informatics skills and knowledge. Potential attendees include SPNHC and TDWG attendees interested in the research data pipeline: collectors, researchers, collection managers, data managers, and data scientists. To integrate this workshop in to the main program, we will propose a coordinating talk during the regular meetings to present experiences and outcomes of this workshop as well as the Carpentries communities we have started at FSU and UF that have trained nearly 300 participants. 	 The workshop will require a room suitable for training 20-30 people (projector, desks, etc.) as well as access to catering or restaurants. We expect that two days prior to the start of the meetings will work best for everyone. Costs for this workshop include a fee to the Carpentries, travel & lodging support for Carpentries instructors, venue costs, and catering if needed for participants. iDigBio will support the attendance of Organizer(s):: and helpers (Matt Collins and Deb Paul). We ask SPNHC and TDWG to support the workshop by funding the venue and catering costs if they are needed. We are going to try to have participants' institutions fund the remaining parts of the workshop in a pay-per-seat model and we have a list of about a dozen institutions with potential interest. GBIF has previously expressed an interest in supporting the workshop.
