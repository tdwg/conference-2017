 <h3><u>Announcing TDWG 2017</u></h3>

<p> We are excited to announce that Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada and the Canadian Museum of Nature will host the 2017
Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) conference in
Ottawa, Canada, Oct. 1 - Oct. 6. It is critical that you
contact us as soon as possible if you would like to host an
event (e.g. training, a hackathon, or a workshop) either
before or after the TDWG meeting, as accommodation space will
be limited. Several options for venues are available. Below,
please find a call for workshop and symposium proposals. Calls
for presentations, computer demonstrations, posters, and
meetings of TDWG Interest/Task Groups will be announced in
April. Use <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tdwg17"
target="_blank">#tdwg17</a> to stay informed.
</p>

<p><font size="+1"><b>About the meeting </b></font> <br>
Standards for the description and exchange of biodiversity
information help promote research, support decision-making for
conservation and planning, and provide a means of
communicating observations across taxa, sub-disciplines, and
political boundaries. The annual TDWG conference serves two
purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li> it is is a forum for extending, refining, and developing
standards in response to new challenges and opportunities;
and </li>
<li> it is a showcase for biodiversity informatics - much of
which relies on the specifications provided by TDWG and
other standards organizations. </li>
</ul>

<p>Our theme this year is <i>Data Integration in a Big Data
Universe: Associating Occurrences with Genes, Phenotypes, and
Environments</i>.</p>

<p>Associating genotypes with phenotypes has been the subject
of previous TDWG symposia, and remains one of the great
ongoing challenges of biodiversity science. It is complicated
by our increased (but still nascent) understanding of the role
played by microbiomes in phenotype expression. (As Bob Robbins
pointed out in his <a
href="http://www.rj-robbins.com/slides/RJR-TDWG-2012.pdf">2012
keynote</a>, some microbial genes, due to inter-species
horizontal gene transfer, are better understood as attributes
of a particular ecosystem than of a particular species.)
Meanwhile, "habitat" remains one of the most over-burdened of
Darwin Core terms, conflating climate, geology, taxonomic
association, and other environmental variables. Our theme is
intended to provoke discussion around questions such as: Can
current systems, methods, and schemas be used to capture and
understand patterns of association amongst occurrences, genes,
phenotypes, and environments? If so, how? If not, what gaps
need to be filled?</p>
