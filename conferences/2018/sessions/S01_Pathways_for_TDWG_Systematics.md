**Abstract:** 

Biodiversity data are, in a significant way (though by no means exclusively), generated and curated by systematists whose research endeavors include creating and revising the names and evolutionary concepts that link occurrence records into biologically meaningful units. Systematists also benefit from the availability of biodiversity data suitable to support and enrich systematic research. That said, this symposium theme starts off by stipulating that the relationship between the systematist and biodiversity data communities "has room for improvement", and that an important first step to achieving this is to actually bring preferably early-career systematists to routinely attend TDWG meetings, interact with leaders of the latter community, have a voice in TDWG working groups and committees, etc. For this "joint new pathways" symposium, I am envisioning an open, widely advertised search for speakers in the systematic community who make abundant use of TDWG-facilitated data while maintaining an active and expanding systematic research program, and who will share with the TDWG community their experiences in working with occurrence records facilitated by standards and on-line services. An underlying motivation is of course data quality and trust in data - where trust is actually not just a matter of the quality (correctness) of the information, but also an outcome of social interactions and designs that give experts an adequate voice in the data aggregation process (see [https://doi.org/10.1093/database/bax100](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/bax100)). Because of my relatively strong connections to an international group of systematists, I believe that I can put together a highly attractive set of outstanding speakers that will represent a "breath of fresh air" for the TDWG meetings, while also increasing the relative participation of younger and otherwise diversity-representing speakers. In turn, I believe that at least some longer-serving TDWG members will enjoy and learn from seeing how for instance a Ph.D. student in insect systematics experiences using data provided through an iDigBio or GBIF portal, how these data get used to support systematic research publications and inferences, how they can enhance an early-career systematist's professional standing, and what design shortcomings need to be addressed to further improve matters. In closing, I believe that this symposium would also bring about good, constructive public relations for TDWG (and SPNHC). It would be a transparent signal that TDWG acknowledges that an important way to improve trust in data quality includes proactively engaging with young generations of systematists for whom publishing new, high-quality biodiversity data is a very central mission.
