 <h3><u>Announcing TDWG 2017</u></h3>
<p> We are excited to announce that Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada and the Canadian Museum of Nature will host the 2017
Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) conference in
Ottawa, Canada, Oct. 1 - Oct. 6. It is critical that you
contact us as soon as possible if you would like to host an
event (e.g. training, a hackathon, or a workshop) either
before or after the TDWG meeting, as accommodation space will
be limited. Several options for venues are available. Below,
please find a call for workshop and symposium proposals. Calls
for presentations, computer demonstrations, posters, and
meetings of TDWG Interest/Task Groups will be announced in
April. Use <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tdwg17"
target="_blank">#tdwg17</a> to stay informed.<br>
</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b>About the meeting </b></font> <br>
Standards for the description and exchange of biodiversity
information help promote research, support decision-making for
conservation and planning, and provide a means of
communicating observations across taxa, sub-disciplines, and
political boundaries. The annual TDWG conference serves two
purposes: </p>
<ul>
<li> it is is a forum for extending, refining, and developing
standards in response to new challenges and opportunities;
and </li>
<li> it is a showcase for biodiversity informatics - much of
which relies on the specifications provided by TDWG and
other standards organizations. </li>
</ul>
<br>
Our theme this year is <i>Data Integration in a Big Data
Universe: Associating Occurrences with Genes, Phenotypes, and
Environments</i>.
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
charset=UTF-8">
<p> Associating genotypes with phenotypes has been the subject
of previous TDWG symposia, and remains one of the great
ongoing challenges of biodiversity science. It is complicated
by our increased (but still nascent) understanding of the role
played by microbiomes in phenotype expression. (As Bob Robbins
pointed out in his <a
href="http://www.rj-robbins.com/slides/RJR-TDWG-2012.pdf">2012
keynote</a>, some microbial genes, due to inter-species
horizontal gene transfer, are better understood as attributes
of a particular ecosystem than of a particular species.)
Meanwhile, "habitat" remains one of the most over-burdened of
Darwin Core terms, conflating climate, geology, taxonomic
association, and other environmental variables. Our theme is
intended to provoke discussion around questions such as: Can
current systems, methods, and schemas be used to capture and
understand patterns of association amongst occurrences, genes,
phenotypes, and environments? If so, how? If not, what gaps
need to be filled?<br>
</p>
<h3><u>Call for Workshops and Proposals</u></h3>
<p>We invite you to submit proposals for workshops and symposia,
which can be organized around already established themes, or
which can be used to explore emerging topics of interest.
&nbsp;At TDWG, a symposium is typically a collection of talks,
sometimes with a panel or open discussion; a workshop may have
talks, but typically encourages more active engagement through
training activities, or through facilitating consensus around
a key issue. Symposia and workshops addressing the conference
theme are encouraged, but other topics relating to
biodiversity information management, integration, analysis,
and standards are also welcomed. Possible topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li> knowledge graphs </li>
<li>metagenomics </li>
<li> citizen science</li>
<li>semantics and ontologies (e.g., sampling, traits)</li>
<li>biological field station data management</li>
<li>collections data visualization </li>
<li>data quality assessment and improvement</li>
<li>agricultural biodiversity </li>
<li> conservation informatics </li>
<li> illuminating dark data</li>
<li>phyloinformatics </li>
<li>ePublications</li>
<li>standards for image processing (e.g. computer vision for
organismal identification)</li>
<li>wikis for biodiversity knowledge</li>
</ul>
For full consideration, please submit your proposal via email to
<a href="mailto:conference@tdwg.org"><span style="font-family:
Arial;">conf-submissions@tdwg.org</span></a> by 10 March
2017 (extended from 1 March). Proposals should be fewer than 400 words, and should
include the following:
<ol type="i">
<li>Names, email addresses, and affiliations of all
organizers.</li>
<li>Whether the proposal is for a workshop or a symposium.</li>
<li>Whether the organizer(s) will accept unsolicited abstract
submissions (vs. inviting all speakers themselves).</li>
<li>Number of 90 minute sessions requested.</li>
</ol>
Please note: As mentioned above, this is a call for workshop and
symposium proposals only. The general call for contributed
papers and posters will be announced in April 2017, after the
symposia and workshops have been selected and announced. Please
address questions to <a href="mailto:conference@tdwg.org"><span
style="font-family: Arial;">conference@tdwg.org</span></a>.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Welcome to Ottawa!</span></h3>
<p>One of the reasons that we are very excited to host TDWG 2017 in Ottawa, is that in 2017 Canada is celebrating its 150th birthday! Many events and celebrations are planned throughout the year. Learn more about the celebrations at <a href="http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1468262573081" target="_blank">Canada 150</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.ottawa2017.ca/" target="_blank">Ottawa 2017</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this year-long celebration, Ottawa is going to be very busy all year and thus hotels and other accommodations are going to be fully booked well in advance. Most Canadian hotels have very flexible cancellation rates, and reservations can typically by cancelled with no charges or fees up to days before the booking (varies by hotel). This means that you should <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BOOK YOUR ACCOMMODATION NOW!</strong></span> (see below for options). Booking early also helps us plan better to make sure accommodation and conference facilities are appropriately sized.</p>
<p>With&nbsp;the conference being held at the Delta Hotel, we are better able to keep the associated conference costs low. This entails a commitment to room reservations at the Delta. If at all possible, and for your greatest convenience, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">please book your TDWG 2017 accommodation at the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Biodiversity%20Information%20Standards%20(TDWG)%20Conference%5Eyowdm%60BOCBOCA%7CBOCBOCB%7CBOCBOCC%7CBOCBOCD%60229-249%60CAD%60false%604%609/29/17%6010/6/17%608/16/17&amp;app=resvlink&amp;stop_mobi=yes" target="_blank">Delta</a></span>&nbsp;to ensure that our commitment is fulfilled.&nbsp;If you haven't&nbsp;booked already, <a href="http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Biodiversity%20Information%20Standards%20(TDWG)%20Conference%5Eyowdm%60BOCBOCA%7CBOCBOCB%7CBOCBOCC%7CBOCBOCD%60229-249%60CAD%60false%604%609/29/17%6010/6/17%608/16/17&amp;app=resvlink&amp;stop_mobi=yes" target="_blank">book now</a>!</p>
