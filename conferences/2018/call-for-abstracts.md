Dear Colleagues,

We are excited to announce the [list of accepted workshops and symposia](https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2018/sessions/index) for [TDWG18](http://spnhc-tdwg2018.nz/), which will be held jointly with the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) in Dunedin, NZ, 25 Augustâ€“1 September, and to make the call for individual contributions to be published in *[Biodiversity Information Science and Standards](https://biss.pensoft.net/) (BISS)*.  Instructions for submitting abstracts may be found [here](https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2018/call-for-abstracts/instructions/). Deadline for abstract submission is **12 March 2018**. Abstracts are required for all oral presentations, computer demonstrations, and posters. These categories are described below.

**Types of Contributions:**

**Symposia or Workshop Presentations**

The backbone of a TDWG meeting are its symposia and workshops. At TDWG, a symposium is typically a collection of talks, sometimes with a panel or open discussion; a workshop may have talks, but typically encourages more active engagement through training activities, or through facilitated discussion around a key issue.  Accepted symposia and workshops are listed [here](https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2018/sessions/index), along with an indication of whether or not the symposium/workshop is accepting submissions. If you would like to give a talk, you should see if any open workshops/symposia are suitable. Note, some workshops may be held on the 24th or 25th of August because of time constraints.

**Contributed Oral Presentations**

If no workshop or symposium is suitable, you can submit your abstract to the "Contributed Oral Presentation" track. Accepted abstracts will be arranged so that talks on similar subjects are in the same session. This year, contributed oral presentations will be restricted to 10 minutes (including changing speakers) to accommodate the time constraints of this joint meeting.

**Computer demonstrations**

We will provide an opportunity for a limited number of live computer demonstrations. Note that rooms for these presentations may have WiFi connections only (not wired), and you may want to have a backup plan should the Internet connection not work to your satisfaction.

**Posters**

We will provide dedicated space for posters, and at least one dedicated poster session on the agenda. Instructions on poster size will be posted nearer the conference.

**Wild Ideas**

Towards the end of the conference, we are planning a "Wild Ideas" session of lightning talks. Abstracts will not be required for these.

Best,

Shelley James
