## Abstract  

Collections, aggregators, data re-packagers, publishers, researchers, and external user groups form a complex web of data connections and pipelines. This forms the natural history infrastructure essential for collections use by an ever increasing and diverse external user community. We have made great strides in developing the individual actors within this system and we are now well poised to utilize these capabilities to address big picture questions. We need to continue work on the individual aspects, but the focus now needs to be on integration of the functionality provided by the actors involved in the pipeline to facilitate the transfer of data between them with as few human interventions as possible. In order for the system to function efficiently and to the benefit of all parties, information, data, and resources needs not only to be integrated efficiently, but flow in the reverse direction (attribution) to facilitate collections advocacy and sustainability. For instance, there are benefits to collections from inclusion into aggregators and subsequent use by researchers and publishers that are not being realized. The Biodiversity Collections Network (BCoN), an NSF funded Research Coordination Network (RCN) is planning a program of workshops in conjunction with other groups to perform a needs assessment to identify gaps and problems in the data pipeline and explore future steps in coordinating efforts, providing solutions and standardizing tools and methods. This symposium follows on from a needs assessment workshop held in Lawrence, KS in February and a follow up workshop held at the iDigBio 2nd Digital Data in Research meeting held in Berkeley, CA in June. The hope is that this symposium will highlight progress made so far in this realm and allow for feedback from the community. Input from both the TDWG and SPNHC communities is vital in solving both the technical and social challenges associated with creating and sustaining these pathways.
