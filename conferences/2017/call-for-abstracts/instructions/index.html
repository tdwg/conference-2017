<h2>Instructions for Submitting Abstracts</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Log in at <a href="http://tdwgproceedings.pensoft.net" target="_blank">http://tdwgproceedings.pensoft.net</a>.</li>
  <li>Click the “Start a Conference Abstract” button to directly
open an abstract manuscript.</li>
  <li>Click “Collections” on the top navigation bar. This is where
you select the conference track to which you are submitting. If
you are an invited speaker for a symposium or workshop, select
that track. If you are submitting an oral presentation for
consideration by an open symposium or workshop, choose that
track. Note that this does not guarantee acceptance in that track. See <a
href="../../program/">the conference program</a> for
descriptions and indications of which track or open to
unsolicited submissions.) If you would like to give an oral
presentation, and no existing track is appropriate, choose
“Other Oral Presentations”. You can also select “Poster” or
“Computer demonstration”. <br>

<img src="../../../../theme/media/arpha-select-collection.jpg" alt="Select Collection" style="height:300px;" class="img-responsive img-rounded"></li>
  <li> Fill in your abstract's metadata by hovering over a category,
and then clicking on the pencil icon. The only mandatory fields
are “Title”, “Abstract”, “Keywords”, and “Presenting Author”.
Titles should have all major words begin with a capital letter;
please do not use all uppercase in your title. The submitting
author and affiliation are taken from the profile of the
logged-in user. More authors can be added by clicking the icon
beside “Authors” in the left side-nav. The corresponding author
and the authors’ order can be changed from the same menu. The
corresponding author must be available to communicate about the
abstract until final acceptance for publication. The presenting
author is the person who will actually be giving the
talk/demonstration at the TDWG meeting in October.</li>
<img src="../../../../theme/media/arpha-edit-sections.jpg" alt="Edit fields" class="img-responsive img-rounded" style="height:400px;">
  <li>Submissions are limited to 600 words written in English and
must address the conference themes or other topics in
biodiversity informatics. Note that this is not a venue for
reporting the results of research in your discipline. Please
write for a general audience with no unexplained jargon. The
first mention of acronyms or abbreviations in the abstract or
figure/table legends must be spelled out (exceptions include
GIS, HTML, TDWG, WWW, URL, XML, JPG, TIF, TIFF, PDF). Please
proofread your submission carefully. </li>
<li> You may add references (not included in word count), one
figure, and one table by clicking on the appropriate icon. You
may also upload supplementary materials associated with the
abstract. </li>
<img src="../../../../theme/media/arpha-add-reference.jpg" alt="References" class="img-responsive img-rounded" style="height:400px;">
  <li>Click “Validate.” This will ensure that mandatory fields are
filled in and the abstract is assigned to a collection. Be sure
to finish this step, even if you and your co-authors are not
finished writing or reviewing your submission. </li>
  <li>When you are ready to submit your abstract, click “Submit for
Technical Review.” This will send the manuscript to the track
editors, who will review it for relevance to the track. </li>
  <li>The editors of the track to which you have submitted your
abstract may accept or reject your submission, or may send
feedback requesting changes, or suggest submission to a
different track. </li>
  <li>Once the abstract is accepted, the ‘Submit to the journal’
button becomes visible in the ARPHA Writing Tool. You need to
click this button and go through a checklist of submission
steps. The fourth and final step asks you to assign categories
to your submission; this step is optional. When the submission
process is finalised, the abstract goes directly to production
and publication, a DOI is assigned, and the abstract cannot be
revised further. </li>

  <li>If at any time you need further assistance, you can send an
email to the journal’s technical staff via the system. Click
“Helpdesk” on the top navigation bar to open a new window with
an email form for you to fill in. </li>
